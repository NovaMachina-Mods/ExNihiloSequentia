Crucible
========
The crucible is used to melt various blocks and items into fluids. Right click the barrel to place an item or block into the crucible. Place a heat source under the barrel to begin the melting process. Once a crucible is full, right click with a bucket to add or remove a fluid.

!!! Note
    An Unfired Crucible *MUST* be smelted to be used.

!!! Warning
    Once an item is in the crucible, it cannot be removed. A crucible will void any fluid in it when it is broken.
