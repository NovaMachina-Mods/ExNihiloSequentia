Barrel
======
The barrel has a wide range of uses. You can use it to compost organics into dirt, transform one fluid into another, transform a fluid into a block with an item, and spawn mobs. When in the rain, the barrel will collect water. Right click the barrel to get a block out of the barrel. Right click the barrel with a bucket to add or remove a fluid.

!!! Warning
    Once a compost item is in the barrel, it cannot be removed. A barrel will void any fluid in it when it is broken.
