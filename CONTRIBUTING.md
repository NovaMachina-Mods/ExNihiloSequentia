# Contributing to Ex Nihilo: Sequentia
## Found a bug?
- **Check to see if an issue has already been created that is or relates to your issue.** This helps to keep the issue board pretty clean. If you find an issue that is related to your bug, feel free to comment on it so that we have as much information as possible to go off of.
- If you do not find an issue related to the one you have discovered, feel free to create a new issue. When you do so:
  - Give your issue a good title.
  - Give a clear description of what the bug/issue is. If it is too vague we cannot guarantee that your issue will be resolved.
  - Give clear and concise steps to reproduce the issue. Again, if it is too vague we cannot guarantee that your issue will be resolved.
  - Explain what you expect to happen.
  - Provide the version of Minecraft, Minecraft Forge, and Ex Nihilo: Sequentia that you are using. This helps us to reproduce your issue.
  - Provide, if applicable (which is most of the time) logs and crash reports. The more information the better! Submit all files through [Gist] or [Pastebin].
  - If it helps to describe your issue, add some screenshots.

## Want to contribute to Ex Nihilo: Sequentia?
Awesome! We really appreciate your help and desire to see Ex Nihilo: Sequentia thrive!
### Have you written a bug fix?
- Be sure to link your pull request to any issues that your bug fix effects.
- Request a review from one of the project maintainers. (Currently there is only one maintainer, [NovaMachina].)
- If changes are requested, or your pull request is rejected, don't get discouraged! We want to make sure that Ex Nihilo: Sequentia is a great experience for everyone, yourself and all those that use the mod. As such, we want to make sure that good code/features are added. And we are aware that we ourselves are not perfect, so you might find some code that isn't so great in the source code. Feel free to clean it up and make a pull request!

### Want to add a feature?
- Start hacking away and add your feature to the code! Or pick one of the suggestions on the issue board and get to work!
- Once your feature is in a good place to be incorporated into the rest of the mod, create a suggestion on the issue board (unless you are implementing a suggestion already on the board), make a pull request, and link your pull request to the suggestion on the issue board.
- Be sure to describe your suggested feature clearly and why it should be added to Ex Nihilo: Sequentia.
- Request a review from one of the project maintainers. (Currently there is only one maintainer, [NovaMachina].)
- If changes are requested, or your pull request is rejected, don't get discouraged! We want to make sure that Ex Nihilo: Sequentia is a great experience for everyone, yourself and all those that use the mod. As such, we want to make sure that good code/features are added.

Be aware that any features that don't fit with the spirit of Ex Nihilo: Sequentia will most likely be rejected.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Unfortunately, pull requests of this nature will most likely be rejected. They generally do not add anything to Ex Nihilo: Sequentia and tend to be a waste of time to review.

# Code Style
We have a few specific code style requirements that we would like contributors to adhear to.
- Do not use tabs, use four spaces instead.
- If at all possible, line separators should be Unix based (`\n`).
- Curly braces should be used as frequently as possible. This includes simple `if` statements.
- Leading curly braces should be on the same line, not a new line.
- No bulk imports. These are considered bad practice and should not be done. Instead, list out all the individual imports for the class.

---
Currently, there is only one developer on the project, so please be understanding and patient as they work through your issues, review your pull requests, and implement new features.
